# FINE3300-Mortgage-Payments
This repository contains my code for Assignment 1. 

The program will ask users for input about their mortgage values, including their principal, interest, and amortization period. 
It will then use these values to calculate and print the user's monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, rapid bi-weekly, and rapid weekly payments.
It works for any range of values and is reusable depending on the user's financial position.
