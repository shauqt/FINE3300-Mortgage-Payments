# FINE3300-Mortgage-Payments
This repository contains my code for Assignment 1. 

The program will take user inputs about their mortgage values including: their principal, interest rate, and ammortization rate. 
It will then use these values to calculate and print the user's monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, rapid bi-weekly, and rapid weekly payments.
It works for any range of values and is reusable depending on the user's financial position.
