# FINE3300-Mortgage-Payments
This repository contains my code for Assignment 1 for FINE 3300. 

The script contains a function that will caclulate the monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, rapid bi-weekly, weekly, and rapid weekly payments of any mortgage. 
It will ask users to input the mortgage's principal amount, interest rate, and amortization period that will then be used in the calculation. 
It works for any range of values; however, it expects the user to provide legitimate input values so no validation checks will be performed on the input values.
It is reusable as any user can input their specific mortgage details and calculate their payments.
